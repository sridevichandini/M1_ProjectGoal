## Introduction
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. It is usually played on paper but as the technology evolved, here is a digital version of it.
This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement and understand multiple C programming concepts.
## Research
Tic-tac-toe Game Features and Benefits
It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m×n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a nd game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2.It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points.

## Benefits
Tic-tac-toe Game offers a few benefits. Here are just a few of them:

## Good Sportsmanship
Like any game, tic tac toe also teaches a person to accept the defeat as well as ackowledge the win.

## Prepares for more complex games
It prepares a person for more complex games because they have to think of multiple things at one time.

## Developement of Coordination
Tic-tac-toe helps develop coordination, fine motor skills and visual skills.

## Mannerism
It helps one to learn how to follow rules and take turns.

## Concentration
It can help to improve a person's concentration as well as strategic thinking
